# Objective:
# Students will use logical (and, or, not) and chained comparison operators in Python to build compound conditions.

# Key Notes:

# and → Both conditions must be True

# or → At least one condition must be True

# not → Inverts True/False

# You can chain comparisons: 1 < x < 5

# Examples:
x = 10
print(x > 5 and x < 15)   # True
print(x < 5 or x == 10)   # True
print(not(x == 10))       # False
print(1 < x < 20)         # True


# Practice Problems:
#if the score is between 90 and 100 inclusive print "A"

score = int(input("What is your score?"))
if score >= 90 and score < 100:
    print("You got an "A")

#if the score is between 80 and 89 inclusive print "B"
if score >= 80 and score < 89:
    print("You got a "B")
#if the score is between 70 and 79 inclusive print "C"
if score >= 70 and score <79:
    print("You got a "C")
#if the score is below 70, print "D"
if score >= 69 and score <60:
    print("You got a "D"")
#if the score is below 60 print "F"
if score <60 
    print("You failed the test.")



# Write an expression that checks if a number is between 50 and 100 (inclusive).

# Write an expression that checks if a number is NOT equal to 0 and greater than 10.

# Use chained comparison to check if 3 < 4 < 5.
